echo New targeted approach:
echo âœ“ Searches for exact complete URLs:
echo   - https://rebrandking.com/panels/SM4trio/dynam/api/
echo   - https://rebrandking.com/panels/SM4trio/dynam/
echo âœ“ Replaces only the "dynam" part with new value
echo âœ“ Expects exactly 8 total URL modifications
echo âœ“ Shows detailed before/after counts
echo âœ“ Provides troubleshooting if URLs not found
echo âœ“ Verifies success with "âœ… SUCCESS: Exactly 8 URLs replaced!"
echo.
echo This approach will:
echo 1. Find the exact complete URLs in smali files
echo 2. Replace only the "dynam" portion
echo 3. Count and verify exactly 8 replacements
echo 4. Show sample of replaced URLs for confirmation
